# Capstone Project 1 - Inferential Statistics

The goal of the project is to determine what skills are needed to get a web development job "right now" in Palm Beach County Florida.

The client is Palm Beach Code School which wants to show that their focus is getting their graduating students hired locally.

The data is sraped from Indeed.com want ads for web developers or programmers.

The key variables are what percentage of the want ads contain any of a list of possible skills.

No inferential statistics are required, but going into the future we could possibly determine trends of the changes in required skills or 
compare the top skills in Palm Beach County with other Florida locations.
